{{this is a|point entity|name=sky_camera|engine=Source 2|sprite=1}} It is used to mark the position of the map's origin inside the [[3D Skybox]]. As your position changes relative to the maps origin it will be scaled and applied relative to the <code>sky_camera</code>.

When the map is compiled, the areas containing <code>sky_camera</code>(s) are skipped during vis calculations. This can be overridden by <code>-forceskyvis</code> on [[resourcecompiler]]{{confirm}}.

By default, only one <code>sky_camera</code> may be active at a time and it cannot move.
