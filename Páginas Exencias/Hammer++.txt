{{hammerpp|4}} is a community-made modification of the {{hammer|3.1|nt=1}} for {{source|3.1}} that provides an updated, more stable, feature-rich version of the editor.

Hammer++ currently supports the following branches of the Source engine:
* {{tf2|4}} (x64 only)
* {{css|4}} (via {{src13mp}}) <!-- same download URL-->
* {{hl2|4}} (via {{src13sp}}) <!-- same download URL-->
* {{dods|4}} (via {{src13mp}}) <!-- same download URL-->
* {{src13mp|4}}
* {{src13sp|4}}
* {{gmod|4}} (x64 only)
* {{l4d2|4}}

It is also included with {{mcv|4}}, in lieu of vanilla Hammer.

Hammer++ for {{csgo|4}} is no longer supported; Ficool recommends using {{gmod|4|addtext='s}} Hammer++ and porting the {{shader|lightmapped_4wayblend}} shader. Alternatively, use {{mcv|4|addtext='s}} version of Hammer++.

==Caveats==
{{bug|{{clr}}
* Always uses Windows's high-DPI scaling setting, even when scaling override mode is set to "Application" in {{w|File Explorer|File Explorer's}} compatibility settings for {{file|hammerplusplus|exe}}. This can result in less real estate than {{hammer4|4.1}}, depending on Windows settings.
}}
{{warning|{{clr}}
* Does not support some features from {{hammer4|4.1}}, such as "[[Convert WAD to VMT...]]", or loading GoldSrc [[MAP]] or [[RMF]] files directly.
* Ignores {{cmd|%notooltexture}}, with no option to disable this change.
* [[Manifest]]s are not supported, only Instances.
* Lighting preview ignores {{code|_minlight}}.
* Since build 8866, "Show alpha" button in texture browser shows the alpha channel as translucency, regardless of if the material actually uses the [[$basetexture]]. This results in inaccurate previews for materials using parameters such as [[$selfillum]] or [[$basealphaenvmapmask]].
::(Builds 8865 and earlier only showed alpha channel if [[$alphatest]] or [[$translucent]] were present, avoiding this issue).}}
