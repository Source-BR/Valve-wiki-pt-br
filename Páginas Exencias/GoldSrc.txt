{{gldsrc|4}} (also known as {{gldsrc|bold|nt=0}}, and formerly just the {{gldsrc|bold|nt=2}}) is a 3D video game engine created by {{Valve|1}} in 1996. It was the driving force behind many famous games of the late 90s and early 00s, such as {{hl|1}}, {{tfc|1}}, {{cs|1}}, and {{dod|1}}. GoldSrc is a heavily modified version of the {{quake|1}} engine and runs on C++ (with some "C" code). GoldSrc and its level editor, {{hammer3|1|nt=6}}, were released by Valve for public use, making it the source of countless community-made modifications.

GoldSrc was replaced by its successor, {{src|4.1}}, in 2004, which currently holds first place as the choice engine for Valve modders. Though GoldSrc is past its prime, many gamers and some third-party developers still seek to use it for mods and level design. 

The engine is actively being updated and maintained by Valve as of 2023, recently with the {{hl|1}}'s 25th-anniversary updates which increased the engine limits and fixed many bugs.

==Features==
{{todo|expand here or add links}}
* '''AI flocking''' - [[NPC]]s can group together, seen with Houndeyes
* '''Skeletal animation''' - allowing for more stable animation of models, compared to the vertex animation in Quake
* '''Higher poly counts''' - GoldSrc allows for far more detailed models than Quake
* '''HD models'''
* '''Scripted sequences''' - Used extensively to tell Half-Life's story
*[[GoldSrc Bot|Player Bots]] {{only|{{cscz}}{{csXbox}}}},
* A3D/EAX hardware accelerated audio - improves [[DSP]] sound effects (such as removing echo's buzzing noises), and add surround sounds support (Removed since 2013 SteamPipe update).
==== Since 2003 Steam update ====
* '''[[VGUI2]]''' - Valve's custom GUI interface mimics most of the Windows controls.
* In-game advertisements ({{cs|2}}, removed since SteamPipe) - Introduced in 2007.
==== Since 2013 SteamPipe Update====
*'''{{mac|3}} support'''
*'''{{Linux|3}} support'''
==== Since 25th Anniversary ====
* '''Increased engine limits''' - Valve has increased engine limitations, allowing for more entities and detailed maps.
*'''[[func_vehicle_(GoldSrc)|func_vehicle]] entity''' support from {{cs|4}}
*'''Native {{Steamdeck|4}} support'''
* '''[[Steam Input]] support''' - Steam Input support was added, which allows the game to support more controllers and buttons.

=== [[:Category:GoldSrc Programming|Renderer]] ===
GoldSrc has two in-game renderers [[Software renderer|Software Renderer]] and [[OpenGL]] (previously three as [[Direct3D|Direct3D 7]] support was removed in the 2013 SteamPipe Update) both renderers have differences.
* '''Colored lighting''' - Quake simply had monotone lighting
* '''Transparent textures''' - Glass can now be used in maps
* '''Transparent Water'''
* '''Water ripple'''
* '''Water waves''' 
* '''Dynamic iris simulation''' - adjust screen brightness automatically. A feature similar to Source's [[HDR|HDR Rendering]]. {{csXbox|only}}
* '''[[Detail textures (GoldSrc)|Detailed textures]] '''{{only|{{cs}}{{hlop4}}{{dod}}{{cscz}}{{czds}}{{csXbox}}}} 
{{bug|Detail texture rendering has been broken since the 25th Anniversary update.}}
* '''Texture Filtering''' - First introduced with [https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/GLQuake GLQuake], a version of {{Quake|1}} that runs on OpenGL.
* '''[[Half-Life High Definition Content|HD models]]''' - Higher polygon and texture quality for in-game models.
==== Since 2013 SteamPipe Update====
* '''FBO renderer''' - A new method of rendering the game, which allows MSAA to work with GoldSrc engine. This also allows the game to run on fullscreen in a borderless window, and aspect ratio that are different from your monitors, for example, 4:3 on 16:9, will not be stretched to fill the black bars.
{{note|You can disable the new FBO renderer using {{code|-nofbo}} command line, note that this will also disable MSAA.}}
* '''MSAA [[anti-aliasing]]''' - GoldSrc now natively support anti-aliasing, specifically, MSAA 4X, which is enabled by default on most modern hardwares. This will reduce the amount of jagged edges/staircases effect on the geometry.

==== Since 25th Anniversary ====
* '''Shaders support''' (OpenGL)
** With shaders support, it also fix the issues with overbright lighting not working under OpenGL.
* '''Dynamic Shadows'''
{{note|This feature was originally from {{quake|4|nt=5}}. To enable Dynamic Shadows {{code|r_shadows}} must be set to {{code|1}}}}
* '''[[Software renderer|Software Renderer]] support on {{Linux|3}}'''

== Half-Life SDK ==
{{main|Half-Life SDK}}
As of August 2013, it is available on {{steamicon|4}} under the "Tools" section. With it comes {{hammer3|4.1|nt=4|linkto=3.x}}, the 3ds Max sources for many cut and retail NPCs as well as player and weapon models, tools for packing textures into [[WAD]]s, and detailed documentation on implementing baseline features such as voice chat into a [[mod]].

The full source code for the latest version of the SDK can be found on [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife?files=1 Valve's Github Page].

{{note|{{hammer3|4.1|nt=5|linkto=3.x}} is the final GoldSrc-only editor released by Valve and can be downloaded separately, such as through the {{sven|4.1|addtext={{nbsp}}SDK}}.}}

{{update|Half-Life 25th Anniversary Update fixes a lot and breaks other stuff.}}
Use [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife/issues GitHub] in order to prevent duplicate or outdated bug reports at the wiki.
{{Bug|only=goldsrc|Various GoldSrc non-standalone mods has been broken with the recent {{hl1|4}} update, as part of its 25th anniversary. Some of these games would crash on startup with Visual C++ error.<br> Other games like {{tfc|4}} was also affected, but appears to work almost perfectly fine aside from HUD scaling fixes were non-functional. And another one such as {{cs|4}}, which has been fixed to support the 25th anniversary update, may have other problems and issues that can crash the game. Additionally, mods that use custom OpenGL renderer (such as {{Paranoia|4}} (non-Xash3D version) and older version of {{cof|4}}, etc...) will be also crashed on startup aswell ([https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife/issues/3710 Issues #3710]).{{Workaround|To temporarily fix this, select the beta branch {{code|steam_legacy}} on {{hl1|1}} (and in some games such as {{cs|1}}) by going to Half-Life > Properties... > Betas > select {{code|steam_legacy}}. Once those games has been fixed, you can opt out by set the beta branch to "None".}}}}
{{Bug|only=goldsrc|Overbright lighting ({{cmd|gl_overbright|1}}) is broken due to an [[OpenGL]] extension used for multi-texturing, which is required for the [[Detail textures (GoldSrc)|detail textures]] used by {{czero|4.1}}, {{dod|4.1}}, and some third-party mods. <br>This make the color less saturated and lighting much less brighter, as well as introduce chromatic aberration on brightly lit lightmaps. <br>The issue was fixed in the 25th anniversary update, which deprecated the {{code|gl_overbright 1}} in favor of {{code|gl_use_shaders 1}}. However, there are [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife/issues/3424 more issues] that was yet to be fixed with the new overbright lighting.<br> This issue can be also found on [[Quake|GLQuake]], but for different reasons. {{workaround|To fix this for the older version of {{hl1|4}} ({{code|steam_legacy}} branch) and most standalone mods, see {{pcgw|Half-Life#OpenGL_overbright_lighting|Overbright lighting}} section in PCGamingWiki's Half-Life page for more information.{{Important|Please note that using DLL-based solutions in {{vac|4.1}}-protected multiplayer servers may result in a false positive ban. Use {{code|[[Command-Line Parameters|-insecure]]}} to disable VAC for local servers. This is not an issue for singleplayer, which is unaffected by VAC. Additionally, GPU driver hacks do not trigger VAC.}}}}
{{note|Even though the overbright was properly fixed with the 25th anniversary update and with the November 19 hotfix patch, which fixes the brightness issues after enabling overbright, along with another one that [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife/issues/3424#issuecomment-1822924828 fixed the underwater fog bug], models [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife/issues/3424#issuecomment-1823797137 may not be affected] by the overbright lighting.}}

{{Bug|only=goldsrc|Creative EAX and Aureal A3D Audio are no longer supported since [[SteamPipe]] update in 2013.

{{Bug|only=goldsrc|Running any GoldSrc game other than {{hl|4}} over around 100-120FPS or higher can cause issues with movable objects (and prior to [https://steamcommunity.com/games/70/announcements/detail/1586880891220596672 October 8, 2019 update], NPC turn rate), being slower or faster. Player movements in {{cs|4}}, {{cscz|4}} and {{czds|4}}, after jumping, will be much slower than normal for few seconds. {{Note|NPC turn rate bug will remains existed on most older, non-standalone mods (which was made on a older version of GoldSrc/HL SDK) when loaded on current version of HL1 (or other GoldSrc games) that have this bug fixed unless the dlls file ({{code|hl.dll}} and {{code|client.dll}}) on the mod folder itself was renamed. But keep in mind that this method may breaks some mods and cause it to crash, or made several new additions such as new weapons, new NPCs, etc... from the mod stops working.}}}}

== Trivia ==
* The term "GoldSrc" comes from development of the [[Source]] engine. A few months before the release of {{hl1|1}}, the Half-Life engine's source code was split into two branches: {{mono|Src}} and {{mono|GoldSrc}}. The {{mono|GoldSrc}} branch was the [[Wikipedia:Gold master|gold master]] version of the codebase, and would be used for the proper release of the game. The {{mono|Src}} branch, comparatively, would be continually iterated upon, adding and changing features for use in [[Half-Life 2|the sequel]], with the term "Source Engine" eventually being picked up by marketing.{{ref|1}}
