{{this is a|brush entity|name=func_physbox}}
It is treated as a physics object.
{{warning|Trying to spawn this entity without a model crashes the game. (for example by {{cmd|ent_create}})}}

== Keyvalues ==
{{Brush rendering note}}

{{KV Targetname}}
{{KV|Impact Damage Type|intn=Damagetype|choices|Sets the "sharpness" of the brush. Sharp objects are far more damaging.}}
:* 0 : Blunt
:* 1 : Sharp
{{KV|Mass Scale|intn=massScale|float|A scale multiplier for the object's mass. Use the convar <code>sv_massreport 1</code> to see the actual mass of the object ingame.}}
{{KV|Override Parameters|intn=overridescript|string|A list of physics key/value pairs that are usually in a physics prop .qc file. Format is 'key,value,key,value,etc'.}}
{{KV|Health Level to Override Motion|intn=damagetoenablemotion|integer|If specified, this object will start motion disabled. Once its health has dropped below this specified amount, it will enable motion.}}
{{KV|Physics Impact Force to Override Motion|intn=forcetoenablemotion|float|If specified, this object will start motion disabled. Any impact that imparts a force greater than this value on the physbox will enable motion.}}
{{KV|Strength|intn=health|integer|Number of points of damage to take before breaking.  0 means don't break.}}
{{KV|Preferred Player-carry Angles|intn=preferredcarryangles|vector|If the 'Use Preferred Carry Angles' spawnflag is set, this angle is the angle which the object should orient to when the player picks it up, with the physgun or +USE.}}
{{KV|Not solid to world|intn=notsolid|choices|If set, the object will pass through world geometry.}}
:* 0 : Solid to World
:* 1 : Passes through World
{{KV BreakableBrush}}

== Flags ==
{{Fl BreakableBrush}}
{{Fl|4096|Start Asleep}}
{{Fl|8192|Ignore +USE for Pickup}}
{{Fl|16384|Debris - Don't collide with the player or other debris}}
{{Fl|32768|Motion Disabled}}
{{Fl|65536|Use Preferred Carry Angles}}
{{Fl|131072|Enable motion on Physcannon grab}}
{{Fl|262144|Not affected by rotor wash}}
{{Fl|524288|Generate output on +USE}}
{{Fl|1048576|Physgun can ALWAYS pick up. No matter what.}}
{{Fl|2097152|Physgun is NOT allowed to pick this up.}}
{{Fl|4194304|Physgun is NOT allowed to punt this object.}}
{{Fl|8388608|Prevent motion enable on player bump}}

== Inputs ==
{{IO|Wake|Wake up this physics object, if it is sleeping.}}
{{IO|Sleep|Put this physics object to sleep. It will wake if given the <code>Wake</code> input, or if force is applied to it. Note that physics objects go to sleep automatically after coming to rest for a while, so you don't really need to use this.}}
{{IO|EnableMotion|Enable physics motion/collision response.}}
{{IO|DisableMotion|Disable physics motion/collision response.}}
{{IO|ForceDrop|If this object is being carried by a player, with the physgun or +USE, force it to be dropped.}}
{{I BreakableBrush}}

== Outputs ==
{{IO|OnDamaged|Fired when this entity is damaged.}}
{{IO|OnAwakened|Fired when this entity becomes awake (collision/force is applied).}}
{{IO|OnMotionEnabled|Fired when motion is enabled due to damage/physcannon/force.}}
{{IO|OnPhysGunPickup|Fired when a player picks this object up, either with the physgun or +USE.}}
{{IO|OnPhysGunPunt|Fired when a player punts this object with the physgun.}}
{{IO|OnPhysGunOnlyPickup|Fired when a player picks this object up WITH THE PHYSGUN. +USE pickups do not fire this output.}}
{{IO|OnPhysGunDrop|Fired when a player drops this object.}}
{{IO|OnPlayerUse|Fired when the player tries to +USE the physbox. This output will fire only if the Generate output on +USE spawnflag is set.}}
{{O Breakable}}
