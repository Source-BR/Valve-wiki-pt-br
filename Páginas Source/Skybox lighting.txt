Skyboxes are the main source of light for most maps, and as such are one of the most important parts of making a map.

===Overview===
Skybox lighting enters the map through every [[skybox|toolsskybox]]-textured [[brush]], representing direct sun/moonlight and diffuse skylight. Its basic properties are controlled by three entities used in combination (four in some games): 

* {{ent|light_environment}} defines the direction, color and intensity of the direct sunlight, and the color and intensity of the diffuse skylight.
* {{ent|shadow_control}} defines the color, direction, and attenuation distance of the [[Dynamic Shadows|dynamic shadows]] that are created by <code>light_environment</code>. Dynamic shadows will be buggy and unconfigurable without this entity.
* {{ent|env_sun}} places a glowing sprite in the skybox to represent the Sun's apparent position in the sky. It has no effect on lighting aside from this.
* {{ent|env_cascade_light}} casts harsh, real-time shadows onto the map, usually copying settings from the {{ent|light_environment}} entity. {{since|{{csgo}}}}{{also|{{bms}}}}
* {{ent|light_deferred_global}} casts dynamic shadows and lighting similar to '''env_cascade_light''' {{only|{{asd}}}}{{also|{{lw}}}}

===Explanation===
To make sense of it all, just make sure you have only one of each of these entities in your map, and that the '''Pitch and Yaw <angles>''' are set the same for all three of them. (''Pitch'' is equivalent to the Sun's angle of elevation from the ground, and ''Yaw'' is its compass bearing.)

These lighting settings—direction, color, brightness, etc.—are fairly specific to the actual image used for the 2D skybox. The [[Sky List]] article suggests some settings for official game skyboxes.  The {{ent|worldspawn}} entity defines which [[Sky List|skybox]] to use. Also note that fog will look wrong if {{ent|env_fog_controller}}'s settings don't correspond to the particular skybox in use.
{{Note|'''Pitch''' can be overridden for <code>light_environment</code> and <code>env_sun</code>, but not <code>shadow_control</code>. The '''Pitch''' override also cannot be switched off and its rotation is measured counter-clockwise from the horizontal (so straight down is -90&deg;) whereas the '''<angles> Pitch''''s rotation is clockwise (so straight down is +90&deg;). The workaround for this is to make sure your '''Pitch''' override merely repeats the '''<angles>''' value; for example, if your <code>shadow_control</code>, <code>light_environment</code> and <code>env_sun</code> '''<angles>''' are "45 -60 0", set the '''Pitch''' override to "-45".}}</onlyinclude>
