{{CD|CSkyCamera|file1=SkyCamera.cpp}}
{{this is a|point entity|name=sky_camera|sprite=1}} It is used to mark the position of the map's origin inside the [[3D Skybox]]. As your position changes relative to the maps origin it will be scaled and applied relative to the <code>sky_camera</code>.

When the map is compiled, the areas containing <code>sky_camera</code>(s) are skipped during vis calculations. This can be overridden by <code>-forceskyvis</code> on [[VBSP]].

By default, only one <code>sky_camera</code> may be active at a time and it cannot move.
{{tip|
* In games with [[VScript]], you can control 3D skyboxes and their properties (including fog) per-player using netprops. This includes making them move. Example script can be found [https://tf2maps.net/downloads/change-sky_camera-script.15872/ here]
* In games without VScript, this [https://tf2maps.net/threads/multiple-3d-skyboxes.35829 workaround] can be used instead for multiple or moving skyboxes.
* Duplicate your main [[env_fog_controller]] and then turn that into a <code>sky_camera</code> so that the fog settings will be carried over.}}
{{note|fog values on <code>sky_camera</code> cannot be changed through inputs (unlike {{ent|env_fog_controller}}) and the max density keyvalue is missing from the FGD by default.}}
{{ModernCodenote|There is some leftover code for multiple <code>sky_camera</code> entities which can be restored in mods. Half-Life 2: Downfall has restored this feature and the work involved is open-source. Downfall's repository can be found [https://github.com/DownFall-Team/DownFall here]. {{Game link|Mapbase}} uses the aforementioned Downfall code and also adds native support for moving (and rotating) skyboxes. Mapbase's repository can be found [https://github.com/mapbase-source/source-sdk-2013 here].}}
{{warning|If the unmodified version of this entity gets removed in the game, then the game will crash. {{todo|Test the modified code for the same issue.}}}}

{{KV|Name|string|intn=targetname|The [[targetname]] that other entities refer to this entity by.|nofgd=1}}
{{KV|3D Skybox scale|integer|intn=scale|This number determines how large objects in your skybox will seem relative to the map.<br>For example, at a skybox scale of 16, an object 1 unit high in the skybox will seem to be 16 units high to player.}}
{{KV|Fog Enable|boolean|intn=fogenable|Enable Fog in the Skybox by Default}}
{{KV|Fog Blend|boolean|intn=fogblend|This will enable blending between two fog colors, based on the direction the player is looking. If the player's viewpoint is equal to the ''fogdir'' vector, the fog will be drawn with the secondary color; if facing in the complete opposite direction, the fog will be drawn with the primary color. <br/> This can be used to approximate the aesthetic effect of diffuse light filtering through the fog, but since the fog effect color is changed for the entire rendered scene, it is best to keep the two colors relatively close to make the blending less obvious. <br/> For example, sunlight with a yaw of 45 degrees and a pitch of -45 degrees could be enhanced using a '''fogdir''' of '-1 -1 1', a '''fogcolor''' of '120 110 100' and a '''fogcolor2''' of '80 70 60'.}}
