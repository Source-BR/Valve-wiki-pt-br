{{for|about=the console command|the place in a game|[[Map (level design)]]|the file format|[[MAP file format]]}}
{{this is a|console command|name=map|notitlechange=1}} It loads the specified map and starts a game on it.
{{warning|For multiplayer games, this command will kick everyone from your server before changing the map, or does a ''hard change'', so to speak. If you want to soft change your map from console use the {{ent|changelevel}} command.}}

==Usage==
{{pre|map <mapname> [gamemode]}}

The .[[BSP|bsp]] extension must be omitted. The game can access both maps in mounted [[VPK]]s and in the <code>maps\</code> folder. Maps that are in a subdirectory of <code>maps\</code> need to have the folder name included in the console command.

{{ModernExample|<code>map de_dust2 deathmatch</code>}}
{{tip|{{csgo}} The optional <code>gamemode</code> parameter can be <code>deathmatch, casual, competitive, armsrace, coopstrike ...</code>, see [[CS:GO Game Modes]].<br>{{todo|A similar list exists for {{l4d2}}.}} }}
