{{this is a|point entity|name=env_projectedtexture|since=Source 2006}} 
It projects a [[texture]] as a dynamic light that affects all objects in the world, optionally with [[Wikipedia:Shadow mapping|Shadow Mapping]]. env_Projectedtexture does not light the world similarly that other light entities which are ray-traced when you compile the map. This light however is real-time and works without RAD.

{{warning|This is the most expensive light entity in the engine, use sparingly. Newer hardware with a good CPU can handle it better.}} 
{{note|While it is technically supported in {{asd|4}} and {{lw|4}}, it is highly recommended that you use {{ent|Light_deferred}} instead.}}
{{Note|Removed from {{bms|4}} in the December 24 2017 update ([[Xengine]] update) and replaced with {{ent|newLight_Spot}}.}}
{{note|Projected textures don't render when the mod folder is called portal. {{workaround|Use a mod name other than portal.}}}}

{{tip|If a game doesn't support this flag, you still can move projected texture. Clear parent each 0.24 seconds and set parent each 0.25 seconds, this will update the projected texture position (parent must have [[attachment]] point).}}

Do not enable volumetrics while this is the case! {{Note|The volumetric shader has been re-implemented in {{portalrev|4}}. It is planned to upstream this to {{P2ce|4}}, however it has not been done yet due to a bug where the volumetric lighting flickers when the player has paint on their face.

| Valve's games only support one shadow map in the [[PVS]] at a time (including player flashlight).
| Official {{src|3.1}} games/stock {{src13|3.1|nt=0}} code
| It is possible to modify/remove this limit in game code by [[Env_projectedtexture/fixes#Enabling_multiple_shadow_maps.|following these instructions]].

If mapping for a multiplayer game without game code access where {{ent|point_servercommand}} is available and permitted, the cvar {{cmd|mp_flashlight}} can be forcibly set to {{code|0}} to disable to the player flashlight and from interfering with {{mono|env_projectedtexture}}.
| The following games/branches have exceptions to this:
*{{gmod}}: 9 (Can be increased with {{code|-numshadowtextures #}})
*{{strata}}: 8
*{{mapbase}}: 4 (Can be increased with {{code|-numshadowtextures #}})
*{{infra}}: 8

| While running in DirectX 9 mode, some graphics cards will not render shadows from {{code|env_projectedtexture}} regardless of the shadow detail setting, and as a result will render the texture through brushes and props instead of properly stopping them
