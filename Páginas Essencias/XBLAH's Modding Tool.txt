{{Xblahmt|4}} is organized in different dashboards depending on which role you have in the mod development. There are dashboards available for mod leaders, level designers, material designers, model designers, sound designers, programmers, animators, and particle designers, each one with a specialized toolset in that field.
{{notice|The Essentials Edition contains only the Modding Dashboard and part of Level Design Dashboard. The Advanced Edition contains the complete toolset.}}

== Game ==

;Create a mod
:[[Create a Mod|Creating a bare-bones mod]] usually requires more than just creating a [[liblist.gam]] or a [[gameinfo.txt]]. Mods based on {{gldsrc|4}} and {{source|4}} games can be created with the {{Xblahmt|4}} using an intuitive interface, that creates all the required files and directories. {{mapbase|4}} mods are also supported. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Game/New Mod|See documentation]]).

;Refresh Mods
:In case you manually added or modified any mods for the current game, you can refresh the mod listing. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Game/Refresh Mods|See documentation]])

</gallery>

== Modding ==
;Run a Mod
:You can run mods straight from {{Xblahmt|4}}, without having to restart Steam when you create or install a new mod. {{Xblahmt|4}} supports lots of different run modes. It contains basic presets for each game, and you can add new ones.  ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/Run|See documentation]])

;Open the Mod Folder
:{{Xblahmt|4}} provides a shortcut to the selected mod folder, proving itself useful in case you need to modify any files manually. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/Open_Mod_Folder|See documentation]])

;File Explorer
:All the files mounted into the game info can be previewed with {{Xblahmt|4}} in the File Explorer. The File Explorer replaces the [[GCFScape]] as the ultimate file browsing tool, since it will mount all the VPKs and loose files according to the game info, to show the modder a comprehensive list of files. This relieves the modder of having to browse vpks individually, and the integrated features of the tool usually dismisses the necessity of extracting the files from the vpks, since they can be accessed natively by double-clicking the file (or right-clicking for more options). ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/File_Explorer|See documentation]])

;Deleting a Mod
:You can delete the selected mod in case you don't want to work with it or have it anymore. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/Delete_Mod|See documentation]])

</gallery>

=== Mod Configuration ===

;Game Info
:The mod information can be edited with {{Xblahmt|4}} through a comprehensive UI without requiring the modder to mess with text files. It includes all the major keys of {{gldsrc|4}} and {{source|4}}. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/Game_Info|See documentation]])

;Mounting Game Assets
:The mod mounted content can be edited with {{Xblahmt|4}}, pointing to directories and [[VPK|VPKs]] in the desired order, without the risk of messing the [[Gameinfo.txt|game info]]. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/Content_Mount|See documentation]])

;Managing Chapters
:Chapters for single-player games can be created with {{Xblahmt|4}} through an UI. The modder can easily create new chapters, select the chapter images, chapter background images, the first map of the chapter, the background map, and the tool will do the dirty work of creating the required vtfs, vmts and scripts. It gives the option to automatically blur the background images, so the modder can just take a screenshot of the background map and the tool will apply the usual blur. This replaces the need of saving [[VTF|VTFs]], creating chapter images with weird proportions, and so on. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/Chapters|See documentation]])

;Starting maps
:For {{gldsrc|4}} games, you can set the map that will be run when you start a new game and the map that will run when you start the training section. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/Starting_Maps|See documentation]])

;Menu Items
:Main menu items can be added, modified or removed with {{Xblahmt|4}} based on a provided list of options. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/Menu_Items|See documentation]])

=== File Management ===
;Packing Files Manually
:Instead of distributing loose files, you can select the files you want and pack them into a [[VPK]]. The selected files will be automatically deleted after they are packed into the [[VPK]], cleaning up your mod folder. The [[VPK]] will be saved under {{path|MOD_NAME/custom/}}. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/Pack_Files_Manually|See documentation]])

;Pack Subdirectory under {{path|MOD_NAME/custom/}}
:Instead of manually packing files into a [[VPK]], you can select a folder under the {{path|MOD_NAME/custom/}} directory and it will convert all the Unpacked Files into a single [[VPK]]. You will have the option to delete the Unpacked Files. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/Pack_Files_Manually|See documentation]])

;Unpacking Files
:You can quickly convert mounted [[VPK|VPKs]] into Unpacked Files, to help during the modding process. All the files in the [[VPK]] will be extracted to the mod folder, and you will have the option to delete the [[VPK]]. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/Pack_Files_Manually|See documentation]])

;Clean Temporary Files
:Before shipping the mod, the {{Xblahmt|4}} provides the modder with a list of unnecessary files, which can be removed with the push of a button. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/Clean_Files|See documentation]])

;Remove Duplicates
:The tool will list all the files that have the same name, relative directory and content and are mounted at least twice, and will give you the option to delete the extra Unpacked Files with a single button click. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/Remove_Duplicates|See documentation]])

== Animations ==

;Scene Editor
The Source Choreography Editor will be automatically configured if ran through the {{Xblahmt|4}}, patching the missing icons. For compatible games, Scene Maker will be installed and run instead. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Animations/Scene_Editor|See documentation]])

{{note|Scene Maker is developed by [[User:Cvoxalury|Cvoxalury]], is available for free and can be downloaded [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UBUN3ks5f_1_g8ecAXQpL_mC55-57jQp/view?usp=share_link here]]. Access to {{xblahmt|4}} is not required to download or run Scene Maker.}}

([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Maps/Map_Editor|See documentation]])

;Compile Maps
:Maps for {{source|4}} can be compiled through the tool. The tool will list and explain the most common options for compiling, making it as intuitive as possible. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Maps/Compile|See documentation]])

;Decompile Maps
:Compiled maps for {{gldsrc|4}} and {{source|4}} can be decompiled through the tool. The tool will list all the mounted maps, both the loose files and the ones inside the [[VPK|VPKs]]. You will be able to decompile the maps without having to extract them beforehand. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Maps/Decompile|See documentation]])

;Open the Prefabs Folder
:{{Xblahmt|4}} provides a shortcut to the selected game's Prefabs folder, proving itself useful in case you need to modify any files manually. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Maps/Open_Prefabs_Folder|See documentation]])

;Extract Used Assets
:You can select {{Path||vmf|icon=file}} in {{Xblahmt|4}} and it will list you all the required assets for the selected files, showing you to which pack or loose folder they belong, and giving you the option to copy what you want to a separate folder under {{path|MOD_NAME/custom/}}. By default, it will select all the files not located inside {{Path||vpk|icon=file}}, but you can extract the files from the {{Path||vpk|icon=file}} on the go, if you want to, in case you are using assets from games not everyone own. ([[XBLAH's_Modding_Tool/Docs/Mod/Extract_Used_Assets|See documentation]])
