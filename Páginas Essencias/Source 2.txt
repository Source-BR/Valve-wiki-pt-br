{{source2|4}} is a 3D video game engine developed by [[Valve]] as a successor to {{src|4}}.
Introduced in 2015, it is used in {{dota2|1}}, {{svrh|1}}, {{hla|1}}, {{s&box|1}}, {{cs2|1}}, and much more.<!-- once this page is a bit longer, this list should probably be shortened. not while it's still kinda short, though. now it did! -->

Development of Source 2 was planned after the release of {{hl2ep2|1}} and other {{tob|1}} games. In 2010, {{l4d2|1}} was privately ported to the {{Src2|name}} engine as a tech demo, with one of the maps recreated in the Source 2 engine. The engine was later made public with the [[Dota 2 Workshop Tools]] Alpha in August 6th 2014 and formally announced by [[Valve]] in March of 2015 at the [[wikipedia: Game Developers Conference|Game Developers Conference]]. It was then implemented into ''Dota 2'' on June 17th 2015.
Valve has announced that Source 2 will be released to the public for free, and it will only take money should it be used for commercial products.

The engine is capable of rendering highly complex and well detailed scenes with minimal framerate drops, thanks to its new 64-bit support alongside Vulkan, Direct3D 11, allowing for better multi-core rendering, better graphics and more efficient 3D rendering.

==Features==
=== Renderer ===
; Native [[wikipedia: DirectX 11| DirectX 11®]] and [[wikipedia:Vulkan|Vulkan®]] support, with Shader Model 5.0 and later.
; Support for both forward and deferred rendering pipelines.
: Deferred rendering allows games to render as much light with little performance impact.
; [[Screen Space Ambient Occlusion]] support
; [[Physically Based Rendering]] support
: PBR render graphics in a way that more accurately models the flow of light in the real world.
; [[Volumetric lighting]] support.
; [[WEBM|WebM]]
: Source 2 uses WebM video, replacing the previous [[BIK|Bink Video format]]. This will allow the cutscenes to take less storage space as WebM provides better compression compared to Bink. WebM is also a open-format compared to Bink video.
; Volumetric smokes {{only|{{cs2}}}}
: Smokes are now volumetric objects, that can be pushed by grenades, bullets, and more. It also react to lighting and the smokes fill the spaces naturally.
=== Physics ===
; [[Rubikon]]
: Valve's new in-house physics engine. Includes support for [[Cloth Simulation]].
=== Sound System ===
; [https://valvesoftware.github.io/steam-audio/ Steam Audio]
: Valve's new in-house sound system licensed under Apache 2.0 license, replaces proprietary Miles Audio System. 
; Improved Steam Audio
: Sounds have been reworked to better reflect the physical environment, be more distinct, and express more game state. They have also been rebalanced for a more comfortable listening experience.
; Other audio improvements
: Improved audio and voice processing.{{clarify}}
=== Networking ===
; Sub-tick system {{since|{{Cs2}}}}
: Tick rate no longer matters for moving, shooting, or throwing.
=== UI ===
; [[Panorama]]
: Valve's new Custom GUI interface that resembles modern web design and authoring (HTML5/CSS/JS). Using .XML and JavaScript files, developers can create dynamic and clean HUDs and menus and even high-quality in-game intractable panels.
: Scalable across any resolution, compared to [[VGUI]] used in previous Source games (prior to {{l4d|1}}) which would become small if the game is running at higher resolution.
=== Tools ===
; Integrated asset management via the [[Asset System]].
; New engine-integrated authoring tools, rebuilt from the ground up.
: All compiling tools except VRAD are now merged into one. The map compiling tool are named as [[Resourcecompiler]].
; {{Hammer5|2}}
: Completely rebuilt [[Valve Hammer Editor|Hammer]] level editor, featuring modern polygon mesh editing tools.
; Hardware accelerated ray-tracing for [[VRAD (Source 2)|VRAD]]
: VRAD3 now requires graphics card with ray-tracing support to preview & bake lighting. This will allow VRAD to quickly calculates lighting data.
: VRAD3 is supported in all Source 2 games since 2022. Some games such as {{hla|1}} and {{Svrh|1}} still provides previous version (VRAD2) for users who want to compile maps on systems that does not support ray-tracing.
=== Programming ===
; 64-bit support
: Faster game performance, and allowing game to access over 4 GB of RAM. Previously, Source 2 also support 32-bit, which has been dropped with the release of {{dota2|4}} update in 2021 (except {{svrh|4}}).

==Limitations==
{{warning|Support for 32-bit, OpenGL, DirectX 9 (includes Direct3D 9), XAudio, and macOS versions below 10.14 were removed in 2021 with the {{dota2|1}} update. {{svrh|1}} is not affected. Newer games such as {{hla|1}} and {{cs2|1}} don't support them.<br>Newer games like {{Cs2|1}} will also require a CPU with SSE 4.2 support.}}
{{warning|Some games like {{cs2|2}} no longer support {{sq|1}}, making things non-trivial to port and with no chance of a proper transition period when both implementations are functional.}}
