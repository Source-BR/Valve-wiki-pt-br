<span style="color:white; font-weight:bold">Half-Life 2</span> (abbreviated as '''HL2''') defines a new benchmark in gaming with startling realism and responsiveness. Powered by then-new [[Source]] technology, '''Half-Life 2''' features the most sophisticated in-game characters ever witnessed, advanced AI, stunning graphics and physical gameplay. This was the first game requiring installation of {{steamicon|1}} when it came out back in 2004.

'''Half-Life 2''' is the sequel to the 1998 '''[[Half-Life]]'''. A sequel to '''Half-Life 2''' was released in 2006, titled '''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'''. A virtual reality prequel was released in 2020, titled '''[[Half-Life: Alyx]]'''.

'''Half-Life 2''' was [[Half-Life 2 (Xbox)|later ported]] for the [[WP:Xbox|Xbox]] console in 2005, as well as for the [[WP:Xbox 360|Xbox 360]] and [[WP:PlayStation 3|PlayStation 3]] in 2007, bundled under '''[[The Orange Box]]'''.

The game has considerable number of physics puzzles which aren't that common in games like [[WP:Doom (franchise)|Doom]], [[WP:Call of Duty|Call of Duty]] and [[WP:Halo (franchise)|Halo]]. Even '''Half-Life''' has fewer puzzles.

* Source shared (<code>hl2</code>)
* '''Source 2013 Singleplayer''' engine branch

== RTX version ==
{{Main|Half-Life 2 RTX}}
A ray-traced version of '''Half-Life 2''' is currently under development by Orbifold Studios, and promoted by [[WP:GeForce|Nvidia]], using Nvidia's RTX Remix tool.

This version aims to remaster the entire game with new RTX lighting, RTX reflections, PBR textures, and a lot more without changing the core gameplay, similar to '''[[Portal RTX]]'''.

== Limitations/Bugs ==
*For more '''Half-Life 2''' bugs, see this [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Half-Life+2%22 GitHub] page.
This section only list various bugs that are commonly encountered.
=== {{unresolved|bugs}} ===
The current version of '''Half-Life 2''' in Steam lacks LDR lighting on multiple game levels (starting from {{code|d1_eli_01}} until the end of [[Nova Prospekt]]). This means that if [[HDR]] is disabled (by selecting None or Bloom only in HDR settings), [[mat_fullbright]] will be set to 1, disabling lighting and making everything bright and flat ([https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/577 relevant GitHub issue]). Because of this, HDR is required to play the game.<br>This issue is not affected in previous version of the game (which use older engines and are compiled in LDR only), and is fixed in '''[[Half-Life 2: Update]]'''.

=== {{resolved|bugs}} ===
There was a bug with the [[Dropship]]'s gun that was unable to turn, this makes the [[Sandtraps]] chapter much easier.{{Cite|1}} Presents since console release on [[WP:Xbox 360|X360]]/[[WP:Playstation 3|PS3]] (remains unfixed) and since 2010 engine update on PC.<br>Fixed in the current Steam version since 2022's the [[Steam Deck]] update of '''Half-Life 2'''. Some third-party mods may or may not include this fix; [[Fixing the Dropship gun|this page]] details how to fix it in your mod.
=== Other limitations ===
{{Important|The macOS (OS X) version of this game does not work on macOS Catalina (version 10.15) or later due to the removal of support for 32-bit-only apps.}}
As of May 26, 2010, the branch of Source under which Half-Life 2 originally ran on [[Source 2006]] no longer exists on Steam, and subsequently replaced by the updated [[Source 2009]] (which later was upgraded again to [[Source 2013 Singleplayer|Source 2013]]. Some old mods which base themselves directly on the game (as opposed to [[Source SDK Base]]) are unlikely to work any more.<br> This also meant that support for running Half-Life 2 on Windows 9x/ME/2000 have been also dropped.

== Technical notes ==
* In the 2006 version of the game, being underwater at [[d1_canals_01]], or in some area on that same map can cause performance drop. Fixed since 2010 with the engine update.
* Although Source [[mod]]s are often described as being "for Half-Life 2", they actually use [[Source SDK Base]]. SDK Base is available to anyone who owns any Valve Source game and provides all of Half-Life 2's content (except [[BSP|maps]] and [[VCD|vcd scenes]]) on a static branch of the engine.
* The Half-Life 2 Collectors Edition, which ships with the [[Source 2004|2004]] version of the game, does not require Steam to run or update (similar to latest version), which meant that it will run on older systems with Windows 2000 and earlier.
* The 64-bit Windows version of Half-Life 2, which existed around 2005-2006, is no longer available.
