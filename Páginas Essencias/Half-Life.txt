<span style="color:white; font-weight:bold">Half-Life</span>, [[Valve]]'s debut 1998 title, blends action and adventure with award-winning technology to create a [[Black Mesa Research Facility|frighteningly realistic world]] where players must think to survive. Named Game of the Year by over 50 publications, it also includes an exciting multiplayer mode that allows you to play against friends and enemies around the world.

'''Half-Life''' is also the debut of the [[GoldSrc]] engine, and was followed by a [[Source]] engine sequel in 2004, <span style="font-weight:bold;">[[Half-Life 2]]</span>.

A PlayStation 2 [[Half-Life (PS2)|port of the game]] was released in 2001, developed by [[Gearbox Software]], which features many changes which were not present in the PC version of the game.

On November 17, 2023, the game received a major update for its 25th anniversary{{ref|1}}, simulating the retail/WON menu UI,{{ref|3}} implementing proper widescreen support with Hor+ [[FOV]] and better UI scaling for high-DPI and 4K (or higher) displays, partially fixing support for overbright lighting, and much more. The game was also available for free to keep until November 20. Additionally, '''[[Uplink]]''' and content from '''[[Half-Life: Further Data]]''' was added to the game. The downside with this update however, is that several non-standalone GoldSrc mods (except custom content and textures) and games (like '''[[Counter-Strike]]''', '''[[Team Fortress Classic]]''' and more) were initially broken with this update; Valve provides a beta build ({{code|steam_legacy}}) to revert to the version prior to the update, to fix the mod incompatibility.

== Content ==
* Half-Life maps ({{code|valve}})
* Half-Life HD pack ({{code|valve_hd}})
* GoldSrc shared ({{code|valve}})
* GoldSrc code

== Chapters ==
'''Half-Life''' has total of 20 chapters, 19 of which are playable.

There are 14 (15 with Hazard Course) chapters set in [[Black Mesa Research Facility|Black Mesa]] and 4 (5 with Endgame) chapters set in [[Xen]].

== Official multiplayer maps ==
{{stub}}
The original release of '''Half-Life''' included 8 multiplayer maps:
* ''Boot Camp'' ({{code|boot_camp.bsp}})
* ''Bounce'' ({{code|bounce.bsp}})
* ''Datacore'' ({{code|datacore.bsp}})
* ''Lambda Bunker'' ({{code|lambda_bunker.bsp}})

* ''Stalkyard'' ({{code|stalkyard.bsp}})
* ''Subtransit'' ({{code|subtransit.bsp}})
* ''Undertow'' ({{code|undertow.bsp}})

Subsequent updates, patches, and several web-site exclusive releases (such as for {{w|icon=0|IGN}} and {{w|icon=0|PC Gamer|PC Gamer Online}}) throughout 1998-1999, added the following:
* ''Crossfire'' ({{code|crossfire.bsp}})
* ''Frenzy'' ({{code|frenzy.bsp}})
* ''Gasworks'' ({{code|gasworks.bsp}})
* ''Team9'' ({{code|team9.bsp}})
* ''The Hill'' ({{code|thehill.bsp}})

'''[[Half-Life: Further Data]]''', a retail-released series of CDs released in February 1999 with more additional content, included the following maps:
* ''DoubleCross'' ({{code|doublecross.bsp}})
* ''Rust Mill'' ({{code|rustmill.bsp}})
* ''XenDM'' ({{code|xen_dm.bsp}})

The February 2001 {{w|icon=0|Planet Half-Life}} Mapping Contest winner, 
* ''Rapidcore'' ({{code|rapidcore.bsp}}) by Michael "Wolf" Schulz
was added in a patch.{{ref|2}}

The '''Half-Life: Further Data''' content was added to the Steam version of '''Half-Life''' in November 2023 in celebration of the series' 25th Anniversary, which also added brand new maps:{{ref|1}}
* ''Contamination'' {{code|contamination.bsp}})
* ''Disposal'' ({{code|disposal.bsp}})
* ''Pool Party'' ({{code|pool_party.bsp}})
* ''Rocket Frenzy'' ({{code|rocket_frenzy.bsp}})
