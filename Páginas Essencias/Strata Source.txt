{{strata|4}} (more informally known as {{strata|3|nt=0}}, and formerly known as the {{strata|3|nt=3}}) is a third-party {{Source|4}} engine branch using licensed code. It is a modified version of the {{csgobranch|2}} that combines the features of both [[CS:GO]] and the {{p2branch|2}}, along with many improvements that bring Source close to modern standards. This engine branch was first released publicly with the launch of {{portalrev|2}}, and is still in active development.
