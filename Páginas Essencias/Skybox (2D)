{{for|information about Skyboxes in {{gldsrc|4}}, see [[Skybox (GoldSrc)]]}}
The '''2D Skybox''' of a {{source|4}} map is a static 360Â° background image that is rendered only through skybox tool textures. This image is composed of six [[VMT|materials]] that are drawn like the insides of an infinitely large cube that surrounds the map.

As opposed to a [[3D Skybox]], it lacks geometrical depth, consisting only of textures without using the {{ent|sky_camera}} entity to display any 3D geometry.

Simply texture a [[world brush]] (not a [[brush entity]]) with the '''<code>[[tool textures#skybox|tools/toolsskybox]]</code>''' or (if you are mapping for the [[Orange box]]) the '''<code>[[tool textures#skybox2d|tools/toolsskybox2d]]</code>''' material. 

In-game, the skybox will be seen ''through'' each surface that <code>toolsskybox</code> is applied to. 

<code>toolsskybox</code> Brushes do ''not'' need to be box-shaped.

{{note|In [[HL2]] the default skybox has visible seams. This is not your fault. See the next section for how to change the default.}}
{{note|Ideally, your skybox should somewhat "wrap" around your map such that there is only a very small/zero amount of space between the play-space and the skybox itself, though it's usually not necessary to have the skybox "hugging" the bounds of the map to achieve reasonable compile times. See [[Skybox Optimization]] for more details.}}
{{warning|You should avoid making a skybox by drawing a big hollowed out cube with the Skybox texture around your map. This can drastically increase VVIS compile times.}}

== Changing the displayed skybox ==
[[File:Sky_change.png|right|200px]]
The skybox for a map can be set in Hammer's [[worldspawn|Map Properties]] dialog. With the correct map opened, follow these steps:
# Go to the [[Hammer Map Menu|Map menu]] 
# Choose '''Map Properties...''' from the drop down list
# In the Object Properties window, select the '''Skybox Texture Name''' field.
# Replace the value with the name of the skybox you wish to display. See [[Sky List]] for a list of available skies per game. To use a custom sky, see below.


In-game, the current skybox can be changed with the cheat console variable <span id=sv_skyname></span> {{code|sv_skyname <skyname>}}.

== Creating a Custom 2D Skybox Texture ==

# Prepare your image files. You don't necessarily need six images, as you can use an image for multiple sides, for example one for the top, one for the bottom and one for all four sides.
# [[Creating a Material|Convert them to VTF.]] Make sure that you enable "Clamp S" and "Clamp T" flags or you'll see seams when running with lower texture detail.
# Create the following six [[VMT]] text files in the directory {{path|\materials\skybox\}}. Note that character case does not matter.
#* {{mono|<skyname>BK.vmt}}
#* {{mono|<skyname>DN.vmt}}
#* {{mono|<skyname>FT.vmt}}
#* {{mono|<skyname>LF.vmt}}
#* {{mono|<skyname>RT.vmt}}
#* {{mono|<skyname>UP.vmt}}
Use the following template for each:
{{CodeBlock|
[[sky (Source 1 shader)|sky]]
{
	[[$basetexture]] <VTF>
	[[$hdrcompressedtexture]] <VTF> // If HDR image is compressed
	[[$hdrbasetexture]] <VTF> // If HDR image is uncompressed, or if skybox is SDR-only
	[[$nofog]] 1
	[[$nomip]] 1
	[[$ignorez]] 1
}
}}
Now, in [[Hammer]], go to ''Map'' > ''Map Properties'' > ''Skybox Texture Name'' and type in {{mono|<skyname>}}, without any side tags.

== Creating a Skybox with XBlah's Modding Tool ==
LDR Skyboxes can be created straight from image files with the {{Xblahmt|4}} using an intuitive interface, that creates all the required vtfs and vmts. All you have to do is select each cubemap face, preview it, and save. It has a built in 3D previewer to check if the skybox is seamless, and supports the regular square skyboxes and the clamped ones.

This can be accessed within the tool through '''Materials > Skybox Editor'''.
