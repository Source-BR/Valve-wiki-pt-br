{{ModernDeprecated|The creator of VTFEdit has abandoned his projects and website, If you encounter bugs please try using the unofficially updated version ({{vtfeditreloaded|4}}).}}
{{vtfedit|4}} is a GUI frontend for the functions contained within [[VTFLib]], an LGPL open source programming library. VTFEdit is a successor to [[VTFTool]] and is written by [[User:Wunderboy|Neil "Jed" Jedrzejewski]] and [[User:Nem|Ryan "Nemesis" Gregg]].

VTFEdit itself was written solely by Ryan and is a .NET-based GUI tool for the creation and conversion of [[VTF]] and [[VMT]] files. It is a powerful tool allowing files of various formats to be converted to/from VTF format in all of the Source texture formats. 

VTFEdit produces [[MIP_Mapping|mipmaps]] and DXTn compressed images using nVidia's [http://developer.nvidia.com/object/dds_utilities.html nvDXTlib] library, offering a wide range of formats and filters.

Other features include the ability to create [[Normal_Maps|normal maps]] from greyscale images, various sharpening filters for MIP Map generation, access to all VTF header flags, a simple tree-based VMT creation system with [[GCF]] access, a WAD conversion tool, a batch conversion tool, and a VMT creation wizard.

{{warning|Support for importing and exporting HDR textures is limited; use [[Vtex (Source 1)|Vtex]] to create HDR textures, and {{no_vtf|3.1}} to export them.}}
{{Important|1=You must have [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21 .NET 3.5] installed to use VTFEdit. The program or Windows will prompt you to install .NET 3.5 if you try to run VTFEdit without it.}}
==Bugs==
{{bug|hidetested=1|VTFEdit will crash if you attempt to paste anything but text into the editor.}}
{{Bug|hidetested=1|VTFEdit DXT decoder has issues that will cause the texture to have [[Fixing DXT Green Tint Compression|green tint]] when extracting it. This is fixed in {{vtfeditreloaded|1}}. The encoder is unaffected.}}
{{bug|hidetested=1|VTFedit may freeze if you are converting a large number of files, in which case you should wait until the process is completed and do not interrupt it.}}
