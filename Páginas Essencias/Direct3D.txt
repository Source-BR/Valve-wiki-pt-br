'''Direct3D''' is a graphics application programming interface (API) for {{win|4|nt=1}}. It is part of {{wiki|DirectX}}. 

{{gldsrc|4}} engines ships with a [[software renderer]], [[OpenGL]] and initially, {{w|Direct3D#Direct3D_6.0|Direct3D 6}}, prior to it being removed in 2013 after [[SteamPipe]] update. Unlike OpenGL (since detail textures support was added in 2004 with the release of {{cscz|1|nt=CS:CZ}}) and like the Software renderer, it doesn't seems to have issues with overbright lighting. Also in {{nightfire|2}}, this game used Direct3D 8 instead.

{{source|4}} mainly used Direct3D 9 (Shader Model 2) renderer, which later was upgraded to support Shader Model 3.0 {{since|{{src06}}}}, but offers backward compatibility with older GPUs using [[DirectX Versions|DirectX feature levels]] as low as DX8 (or DX7, DX6 in previous version of Source). {{l4dbranch|2}} requires GPUs with Direct3D 9.0/DX9.0c (Shader Model 3.0) support in order to run.

Some third-party engine branch like {{tfbranch|2}} and {{strata|2}} use Direct3D 11 instead. As of 2024, nearly all of Valve games also added support for [[Vulkan]] renderer on Windows, using DXVK to translates D3D9 to Vulkan. Enabling Vulkan translation will require the "{{code|-vulkan}}" launch option (except in {{portalrtx|1}} and upcoming {{hl2rtx|1}}).

{{source2|4}} mainly uses Direct3D 11, but also has options to use the [[Vulkan]] renderer.

====Features====
*'''Support for windowed video mode'''
*'''Texture Filtering'''

====Missing Features and Limits and Problems====
*'''No Rudimentary Shadows'''
*'''No 32-bit color'''
*'''Many resolutions from vanilla quake are not unsupport'''

== {{gldsrc|4|nt=4}} Direct3D==
* Runs on Direct3D 6
====Features====
* '''Colored lighting''' - Quake simply had monotone lighting
* '''Transparent textures''' - Glass can now be used in maps
*'''Texture Filtering''' - Quake ([https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/GLQuake GLQuake]) simply Texture Filtering
* '''[[Detail textures (GoldSrc)|Detailed textures]] '''
* '''Dynamic iris simulation''' - similar to [[HDR|HDR Rendering]] {{csXbox|only}}

== {{Src|4}} Direct3D ==
* Primarily runs on Direct3D 9.0. Later version of Source branch (starting {{l4d|1}}) uses Direct3D 9.0c (and third-party engine branches use Direct3D 11 or 12).
* Prior to {{l4dbranch|1}}, Source supports [[DirectX Versions|DirectX compatibility levels]] for older graphics card (such as DirectX 8 level card) that only support some, but not all DX9 features.
* See {{source|1}} page for features.

== {{Src2|4}} Direct3D ==
* Runs on Direct3D 11
* See {{source2|1}} page for features.
